      I'll worry about styling later, after all this is just a page full of my random thoughts put into words. 
      This page is a representation of my bad creative writing really. 
      I mean I could probobly just go on about nothing and it would be something idk what am I even talking about.
      <br>
      <br>
      Um to continue on with my random randomness, my random rambles that randomly go on for a random about of time, I will now talk about camera technology (particularly film cameras).
      To begin, I will explain the concept of film, and I don't mean film as in a feature film but film as in the little thing a polaroid prints out or film as in the thing you see in shows or movies set in the 80s or 90s where they're in the darkroom yk.
      Film is made up of several layers, for this case we will describe the base layer as a peice of white paper, which on top of this paper contains multiple layers. 
      I will not be going into what which particular layer does as they are not necessarily that important, what is important is the layer that reacts to light.
      Now you may be wondering what I mean by "Reacts with light", but really it's quite straightforward.
      This material, when exposed to light, has a chemical reaction which causes it to, when developed in a darkroom, will show the color black.
      So bright areas will be black and dark areas will be light, showing a negative view of what you are taking a photo of.
      This film only shows black and white images, color film will be explained later.
      However you may have noticed that this image is a negative of what you see in the real world, this is sadly unavoidable but is overcome.
      The film you put in a film camera is transparent instead of having a paper backing, which allows for light to pass through after the film is fully developed.
      An enlarger is used to copy this image onto another peice of film, this time the paper version, turning the negative from the transparent film into a positive on the paper film (a negative times a negative is a positive afterall).
      I'm not sure if that explaination was any good, would probobly be better with images but sadly I do not have a film camera to take pictures of for this case.
      Now color film uses the same principle, in fact it also produces negatives like black and white film, this time though, it has three light sensitive layers, each sensitive to a different frequency of light.
      These three frequencies are Red, Green, and Blue, which if you're familiar with computers or screens or whatever, you will know is known as RGB.
      These colors are used because with these three colors you can make any color on the visible spectrum, I may go into this more in another ramble.
      Like I said the color film also creates a negative, which when using the same technique as with the black and white film, can be turned into a positive with an enlarger.
      pretty crazy...

      I probobly could have explained how a camera works first, but I don't feel like changing the past so I'll just do it now.
      A camera works by exposing film to focused light for a set amount of time.
      This time is called the Shutter Speed of the camera because it represents how long the Shutter of the camera is open.
      To take a picture you usually click a button which opens the shutter for the set amount of time (in seconds) specified and then closes it, if you are using a DLSR camera then that's what the clicking noise is when you click the shutter release button.
      The shutter speed is represented as a fraction, the larger the number the longer it will be open and vice versa.
      Depending on how long the shutter is open the film will be lighter or darker, otherwise known as overexposed or underexposed.
      There is also two other things that determine how exposed your film is when taking a picture, one being Aperture and the other being ISO.
      The aperture is the hole light has to pass through in the camera in order to reach the film, think of it as two equilateral triangles sitting parallel to eachother and touching eachother's tips, that is the light getting focused through the aperture.
      You can change the width of the aperture (in millimeters) to change how much light makes it through to impact the film.
      ISO is a film which can range from a variety of numbers, the numbers determine how much light it takes for the film to be fully exposed, for example 100ISO would take the longest and 1600ISO would take much shorter.
      All of these can be manipulated to change how your images are exposed to light, allowing you to take good pictures in almost any environment.
      There are, however, other things these options change other than exposure of your image.
      Shutter speed effects the amount of motion blur present in your images, as your film is being exposed for longer amounts of time, if the camera is moved it will create a blurry image.
      Apeture effects the depth of feild, or the area in focus in your images; the lower the aperture, like f4.5 would have the smallest depth of feild and the most blur, while f22 would have a large depth of feild and almost no blur.
      And lastly, ISO effects the image's grain, with lower ISOs you will have to wait longer but will get sharper images, while higher ISOs will be faster but more grainy.
      <br>
      There you go, there are the basics of how cameras work. done.
